<p>A <em>Window Proxy</em> is a wrapper for the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window"><code>Window</code></a> object. 
It exist in every <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browsing_context"><code>Browsing Context</code></a>.
All operations performed on the Window Proxy will also be applied to it's underlying
wrapped Window object. Therefore, interacting with the Window Proxy object is almost 
identical with interacting with the Window</a> object until the 
Browsing Context is navigated.</p>
