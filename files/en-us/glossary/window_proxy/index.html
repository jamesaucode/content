<p>The <em>Window Proxy</em> object is a wrapper for the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">Window</a> object. 
It exists in every <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browsing_context">browsing context</a>.
All operations performed on a Window Proxy object will also be applied to its underlying
wrapped Window object. Therefore, interacting with the Window Proxy object is almost 
identical to interacting with the Window</a> object until the browsing context is navigated.</p>
